## Precautionary Measures during Penetration Tests

We have prepared a list of precautions we highly recommend following during each penetration test to avoid violating most laws. In addition, we should also be aware that some countries have additional regulations that apply to specific cases, and we should either inform ourselves or ask our lawyer.
