### **Network Layer (Layer 3) - Summary**

The **Network Layer** of the OSI model manages the routing and forwarding of data packets across networks. Since packets cannot be directly sent to the receiver, they are routed through intermediate nodes until they reach their destination.

#### **Key Responsibilities:**

- **Logical Addressing** – Assigns unique addresses to devices.
- **Routing** – Determines the best path for data packets to travel.
- **Connection Management** – Sets up and clears communication channels.
- **Data Flow Control** – Manages traffic to prevent congestion.

#### **Common Protocols:**

- **IPv4 / IPv6** – Internet Protocol for addressing and routing.
- **IPsec** – Ensures secure communication.
- **ICMP** – Used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping).
- **IGMP** – Manages multicast group membership.
- **RIP & OSPF** – Routing protocols for network path selection.

Packets are forwarded through routers when direct communication is not possible. These routers determine intermediate destinations and forward packets until they reach their final target.
