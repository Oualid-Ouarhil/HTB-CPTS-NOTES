Most networks use a `/24` subnet, so much so that many Penetration Testers will set this subnet mask (255.255.255.0) without checking. The /24 network allows computers to talk to each other as long as the first three octets of an IP Address are the same (ex: 192.168.1.xxx). Setting the subnet mask to `/25` divides this range in half, and the computer will be able to talk to only the computers on "its half." We have seen Penetration Test reports where the assessor claimed a Domain Controller was offline when it was just on a different network in reality. The network structure was something like this:

- Server Gateway: 10.20.0.1/25
- Domain Controller: 10.20.0.10/25
- Client Gateway: 10.20.0.129/25
- Client Workstation: 10.20.0.200/25
- Pentester IP: 10.20.0.252/24 (Set Gateway to 10.20.0.1)
